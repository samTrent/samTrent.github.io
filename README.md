  Hello and thanks again for giving me a chance to continue in the interview process for interning at Walmart Labs!

  So for this project I implemented a single page applicaton by using ajax requests to dynamiclally display
display information in a simple HTML table. Simply enter a search query into the text field then press the search button
and it should display the first 10 results dynamically in the table. After that you can then click on the thumbnail or the 
product name and it will return more information about that product using another ajax request.

  I really enjoyed learning how to use the Walmart Labs API, however, I was unable to get the "Product recommendation API"
working properly. The ajax request that is responsible for getting the product recommendation throws an error everytime its
called. I spent a lot of time doing research on why this particular request wasnt working, but even after seeking help from
a few of my colleagues and my professor I was unable to determine what the problem was. 

  Its really weird because in the console the error report says that the readyState is 4 and the status is 200 but it also says 
that there was a "parse error". I had it return the URL in a console.log() and I entered it into my browser, lo and behold 
it worked and returned the JSON data. However, for whatever reason it still will not work in my ajax request. The only other 
lead that I had was error that said "TypeError: 'arguments', 'callee', and 'caller' cannot be accessed in this context". I did
a lot of google searching and I was unable to come up with anything helpful. 

  I regret that I was unable to fully complete this assignment but I am looking forword to hearing from you so I can see where
I went wrong! I wish I was able to commit more time to researching this problem, it really has me curious as to what going on
with my ajax request.

Thanks!
Sam Trent
